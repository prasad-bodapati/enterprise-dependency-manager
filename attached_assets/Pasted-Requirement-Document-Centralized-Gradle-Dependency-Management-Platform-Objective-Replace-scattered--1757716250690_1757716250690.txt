Requirement Document: Centralized Gradle Dependency Management Platform
Objective
Replace scattered, individually maintained Gradle dependency declarations with a centralized app and API-driven integration. Teams onboard components via UI and declare dependencies (open source or internal Nexus/Maven) with configuration types (implementation, api, compileOnly, etc.). A custom Gradle plugin automates dependency fetching at build, compile, and test phases by calling the app.

Functional Requirements
1. UI & Backend: Component Onboarding & Dependency Declaration
* Component/Project Registration
    * Allow users/teams to register new or existing components/projects.
    * Each component has metadata and dependency records managed centrally.
    * Allow project to have multiple components with their repository
    * Allow each component to have multiple submodules
* Dependency Search & Selection
    * Integrate with internal Nexus/Maven repositories and display available artifacts.
    * Allow keyword/group/artifact/version search for dependencies.
    * Show dependency details (name, version, description, transitive dependencies).
* Dependency Declaration
    * Let users select a dependency and its Gradle scope/configuration (implementation, api, compileOnly, testImplementation, etc.).
    * Persist all selected dependencies and types per component/project, editable via UI.
* Version Catalog and BOM Support
    * Optionally support Gradle Version Catalogs or BOMs for shared version control across multiple modules or projects.
    * Provide admin interface for catalog creation and updates.
* Audit and Change History
    * Log changes to dependencies, versions, and configurations.
    * Show audit/history per component to trace updates and resolve issues.
* Vulnerabilities management
    * For each dependency added check whether there any vulnerabilities reported
    * Maintaining historical information of each component what dependencies they have and vulnerabilities reported against the component
* Dashboard
    * Each project dashboard should list of components with number of vulnerabilities reported
    * Ability to filter level of vulnerabilities critical/medium low
* Automated version updates
    * Ability to update a version of library for all components with click
* Component dependencies version management
    * Each time a dependency is updated in the system create a new version in the system
    * This will the actual plugin to pull particular packaged versions of dependencies not only the latest versions
2. Gradle Plugin: Automated Dependency Resolution
* API Integration
    * At build, compile, and test phases, the plugin calls the central app API to fetch the currently declared dependencies and types for the module/project.
    * Parse and inject dependencies programmatically using Gradle’s APIs (in the correct scopes).
* Dynamic Dependency Application
    * Applies injected dependencies at configuration time, ensuring alignment with the central app.
    * Optionally enforces plugin-only managed dependencies (disallowing local build.gradle changes) to avoid drift.
* Repository Configuration
    * Plugin configures Gradle to use repositories (internal Nexus/Maven, open source) as specified in the app.
* Error Handling & Reporting
    * If resolution fails (missing artifacts, wrong version, repository error), fail gracefully and report errors through the build output and app UI.
* Show dependencies 
    * A grade task on the plugin should show list of dependencies for that component/module 

Non-Functional Requirements
* Security
    * Support user authentication, permissions for component modification, and API access control.
    * Integration with enterprise SSO if required.
* Performance
    * Fast, responsive API queries and UI experience for dependency lookup, onboarding, and audit trail.
    * Handle hundreds of projects, thousands of dependencies efficiently.
* Scalability
    * Architecture supports large orgs with many teams and frequent dependency updates.
* Extensibility
    * Modular backend and plugin design enables future support for other build tools or enhanced reporting.

User Experience
* Intuitive UI
    * Guided registration, search, selection, and edit flows.
    * Clear workflow for adding/removing dependencies, setting configuration types, and updating versions.
    * Visible audit trail and error feedback.
* Collaboration
    * Roles (admin, member) for managing dependencies, catalogs, and updates.
    * Team-based access to shared dependency lists.
* Documentation
    * Online documentation on onboarding components, using the plugin, and troubleshooting common issues.

Implementation and Integration Guidelines
* Use RESTful APIs for backend/plugin communication.
* Backend to maintain strong referential integrity on component/dependency records.
* Consider usage of Gradle Version Catalog or BOM for shared versions.
* Favor automation and transparency to reduce manual version updates and configuration drift.

This solution enables teams to streamline onboarding, ensure dependency consistency, eliminate manual edits to build.gradle, and automate dependency resolution using modern Gradle and repository management practices.
