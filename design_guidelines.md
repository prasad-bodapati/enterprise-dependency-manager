# Design Guidelines: Centralized Gradle Dependency Management Platform

## Design Approach
**Enterprise-focused utility application** following **Material Design** principles for consistency, clarity, and professional appearance. This platform prioritizes efficiency and learnability for developers managing complex dependency structures.

## Core Design Elements

### A. Color Palette
**Primary Colors:**
- Light Mode: Deep Blue (220 85% 25%) for headers and primary actions
- Dark Mode: Soft Blue (220 60% 70%) for contrast and readability
- Neutral grays (0 0% 15% to 0 0% 95%) for backgrounds and text

**Accent Colors:**
- Success Green (142 75% 35%) for successful operations
- Warning Orange (35 85% 55%) for version conflicts
- Error Red (0 75% 50%) for critical issues

### B. Typography
- **Primary:** Inter via Google Fonts for excellent readability
- **Code/Technical:** JetBrains Mono for dependency declarations and code snippets
- Hierarchy: Large headers (text-2xl), section titles (text-lg), body text (text-base), code (text-sm)

### C. Layout System
**Tailwind spacing primitives:** 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16
- Consistent padding: p-4 for cards, p-6 for sections
- Margins: mb-4 between elements, mb-8 between sections
- Grid gaps: gap-4 for dense layouts, gap-6 for breathing room

### D. Component Library

**Navigation:**
- Horizontal top navigation with platform logo and user menu
- Sidebar navigation for main sections (Projects, Dependencies, Components, API)
- Breadcrumb navigation for deep hierarchies

**Data Display:**
- Clean tables with alternating row colors and hover states
- Dependency cards showing name, version, scope, and status
- Project overview cards with metrics and quick actions
- Search results with filtering sidebar

**Forms:**
- Material Design-inspired input fields with floating labels
- Multi-select dropdowns for dependency scopes
- Auto-complete search for dependency names
- Form validation with inline error states

**Enterprise Features:**
- Dashboard widgets for metrics and recent activity
- Modal dialogs for dependency configuration
- Expandable sections for detailed dependency trees
- Status badges for version conflicts and updates

## Visual Treatment

**Professional Enterprise Aesthetic:**
- Clean, spacious layouts with generous whitespace
- Subtle shadows and borders for depth without distraction
- Consistent iconography using Material Icons
- Muted color palette that reduces eye strain during long sessions

**Information Hierarchy:**
- Clear visual separation between sections
- Prominent search functionality
- Quick action buttons for common tasks
- Progressive disclosure for complex dependency configurations

**No Hero Images:** This utility-focused platform prioritizes functionality over visual marketing elements. The interface leads directly to core functionality.

## Accessibility & Usability
- High contrast ratios for all text
- Keyboard navigation support throughout
- Screen reader-friendly labels and descriptions
- Consistent dark mode implementation across all components
- Loading states for API-dependent operations
